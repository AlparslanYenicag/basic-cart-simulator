# Basic Cart Simulator (Console-Based)

This is a simple **JavaScript-based shopping cart simulation**, built using `prompt()` inputs and console logging for output.  
It was created as a basic JavaScript practice assignment to strengthen understanding of objects, arrays, functions, and user input.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to simulate basic e-commerce functionality — such as adding/removing products and calculating total price — using only core JavaScript and console interaction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML (as a wrapper)  
- JavaScript

## ✅ Features

- Prompt-based user data input (name, age, job)  
- Adding products to a cart  
- Removing products from the cart  
- Calculating the total cart value  
- All results shown via `console.log`

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Creating and updating arrays and objects  
- Writing reusable functions for common operations  
- Using `reduce()` for total calculation  
- Practicing logical flow with user interaction

## 👀 Why This Project Matters

Although there is no visible UI, this project captures essential JavaScript thinking.  
It reflects the process of **data structuring, state updates, and procedural logic** — which are fundamental to all modern JS frameworks.
